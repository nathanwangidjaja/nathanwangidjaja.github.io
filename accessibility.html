<h1>Accessibility Review of SPH's Home Page</h1>
<div> I have configured that SPH's webpage, <a href="https://sph.edu"> SPH </a>  has a total of 29 errors. Most of them being due to their inappropriate use of images. The last four errors were due to their late response time, error coding, runtime disfunctions, and the overall content. However, I would say that they effectively created and designed their website with full established coding well. Based on my Web Accessibility Checklist above,they managed to make the design simple, avoid flashy content, and added captions to multimedia in order to be able to illustrate the message its trying to convey. </div>
